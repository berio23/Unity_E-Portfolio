# Unity_E-Portfolio
This is my Repository for my E-Portfolio about the Game Engine Unity3D.
In my E Portfolio i want to share some core elements and functions of Unity first in the form of a little powerpoint
presentation. I want to keep it rather short because my main focus will be on the pratical presentation where i want
to crate a neat space shooter game with you! We will go through all the important steps like,

```
  -Player Movement
  -Scene Creation
  -Working with Prefabs
  -Collision detection
  -Working with UI Elements
  -Using unitys particle system
```

## Basic Infomation
Unity is a game engine and IDE developed and published by Unity Technologies. It is considered one of the most widely known and used game engines
world wide, next to for example Unreal Engine, another really widely used game engine.
Unity is layed out for both Pc and Mobile Games, with unique features for both platforms.
The Personal version is free to use as long as you dont earn more than 100.000 $ a year with the game you just developed.

## Most Important functionalities
There are many useful features built in Unity, too many to list them all here.
If interested you can see the Documentation for Unity [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/560/Documentation/Manual/UnityManual.html).
Regardless i want to list the ones that i see as most essential.

### Scene View
The Scene View is the view you will use when placing new Objects or overall in the developement part of the games creation. Here you can move Objects around and look at
them for any Perspective. It is also the default view when you open a project for the first time.
