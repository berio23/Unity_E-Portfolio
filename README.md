# Unity_E-Portfolio
This is my Repository for my E-Portfolio about the Game Engine Unity3D.
In my E Portfolio i want to share some core elements and functions of Unity first in the form of a little powerpoint
presentation. I want to keep it rather short because my main focus will be on the pratical presentation where i want

  -Player Movement
  -Scene Creation
  -Working with Prefabs
  -Collision detection
  -Working with UI Elements
  -Using unitys particle system
