# Unity_E-Portfolio
This is my Repository for my E-Portfolio about the Game Engine Unity3D.
In my E Portfolio i want to share some core elements and functions of Unity first in the form of a little powerpoint
presentation. I want to keep it rather short because my main focus will be on the pratical presentation where i want
to crate a neat space shooter game with you! We will go through all the important steps like,

```
  -Player Movement
  -Scene Creation
  -Working with Prefabs
  -Collision detection
  -Working with UI Elements
  -Using unitys particle system
```

## Basic Infomation
Unity is a game engine and IDE developed and published by Unity Technologies. It is considered one of the most widely known and used game engines
world wide, next to for example Unreal Engine, another really widely used game engine.
Unity is layed out for both Pc and Mobile Games, with unique features for both platforms.
The Personal version is free to use as long as you dont earn more than 100.000 $ a year with the game you just developed.

## Most Important functionalities
There are many useful features built in Unity, too many to list them all here.
If interested you can see the Documentation for Unity [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/560/Documentation/Manual/UnityManual.html).
Regardless i want to list the ones that i see as most essential.

### Scene View
The Scene View is the view you will use when placing new Objects or overall in the developement part of the games creation. Here you can move Objects around and look at
them for any Perspective. It is also the default view when you open a project for the first time.

### Game View
The Game View gives you the ability to see your game the way future players would see it. In it you can play the game and test everything you just implemented.

### Mobile App
When creating games for mobile it is crucial to test the game on a actual mobile phone. Unity provides a functionality to test games on your mobile phone,
without having to build the game again and again. The Unity Mobile App allows you to use the Game View on your mobile phone. All you have to do is plug your phone into the PC using a USB cable.

### Particle System
One of the trademark features of Unity is its particle system. It allows users to create particels of any variant and customize them with numerous
settings and also with scripts.

### Animation System
The animation system is the functionality which allows the user to create animations of all sort. It consists of the animation window and the animator.
While the animation window is used to create the animations, the animator is used to create transitions between various animations depending
on variables.

### Unity Asset Store
In its time being publically available now the Unity community is grown alot and all kind of assets can already be found on Unitys own asset store.
Here you can download and import numerous assets to use them in your own project. There is a wide selection of free and paid assets.
